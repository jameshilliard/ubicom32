 * Ubicom32 Endian-ness.  In little endian mode, the data bus is connected such
 * that byte accesses appear as:
 *  0 = d0...d7, 1 = d8...d15, 2 = d16...d23, 3 = d24...d31
 * and word accesses (data or instruction) appear as:
 *  d0...d31
 *
 * When in big endian mode, byte accesses appear as:
 *  0 = d24...d31, 1 = d16...d23, 2 = d8...d15, 3 = d0...d7
 * and word accesses (data or instruction) appear as:
 *  d0...d31
